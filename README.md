# Password Generator
Description: A password will randomly be generated based on the criteria given by the client when prompted.

Upon clicking the red "Generate Password" button, the user will be prompted for their desired password length in the range of 8-128. If the user responds outside the given range, the prompt will loop until the range given fits the range given. 

Then, another prompt will ask the user if they would like to include or not include the following: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters. The prompt will loop until the user choses at least one criteria.

After defining all parameters, the user will recieve a generated password within their criteria that will appear within the box.

The application must retain and look like the mock up image below
